```haskell
import Data.List (sort)

main :: IO ()
main = do
  let xs = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
  let ys = sort xs
  print ys
```
This code is seemingly simple, but it hides a potential issue.  The `sort` function in `Data.List` uses a merge sort algorithm, which has a time complexity of O(n log n). While this is efficient for most cases, it's not the most efficient solution for already sorted lists. If you are working with frequently sorted lists and performance is a major factor, this could become a significant bottleneck.

The problem is that the code does not check if the list `xs` is already sorted. If it is already sorted, then using `sort` is redundant and inefficient.  A more optimized solution would first check if the list is sorted, and only then use the `sort` function.
